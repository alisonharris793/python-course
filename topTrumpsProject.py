# Must Have (non-negotiable product needs that are mandatory for the team)
# Generate a random number between 1 and 151 to use as the Pokemon ID number
# Using the Pokemon API get a Pokemon based on its ID number
# Create a dictionary that contains the returned Pokemon's name, id, height and weight (â˜… https://pokeapi.co/)
# Get a random Pokemon for the player and another for their opponent
# Ask the user which stat they want to use (id, height or weight)
# Compare the player's and opponent's Pokemon on the chosen stat to decide who wins
#
# Should Have (important initiatives that are not vital, but add significant value)
# Get multiple random Pokemon and let the player decide which one that they want to use
# Play multiple rounds and record the outcome of each round. The player with most number of rounds won, wins the game
# Record high scores for players and store them in a file
#
# Could Have (nice to have initiatives that will have a small impact if left out)
# Introducing the game to the player and asking if they'd like to play
#Ask if the player would like to play again
# Allow the opponent (computer) to choose a stat that they would like to compare
#
# Will Not Have (initiatives that are not priority for this specific time frame)
# Changing API option
# Using different stats for the Pokemon from the API
